  Installation Instructions

1. Unpack the tar ball containing the source code into some 
  directory.

2. Create a new director in which to build the library.

3. Use cmake to initialize the build tree.

  user@hostname:build_path$cmake /path/to/cgns/sources/


4. Use ccmake to edit the control variables as needed.

  user@hostname:build_path$ccmake .


  (a) Unless a precompiled version of hdf5 is to be used, 
    'BUILD_LOCAL_HDF5' should be left as true.

  (b) Fortran can be enabled by toggling the 'ENABLE_FORTRAN' 
    variable.

    i. A view of the attempt to autodetect the correct interface 
      between Fortran and C is show, setting the value of 
      'FORTRAN_NAMING'.

    ii. For gfortran and pgf90 the value of 'FORTRAN_NAMING' 
      shoud be 'LOWERCASE_'.

  (c) The build system must be reconfigured after variable 
    changes by pressing 'c'. Variables who's value has changed 
    are maked with a '*' in the interface.

  (d) After configuration, the Makefiles must be generated by 
    pressing 'g'.

5. Use make to build the library.

  user@hostname:build_path$make


  (a) A colorized review of the build process should follow.

6. Installation of the library is accomplished with the 'install' 
  target of the makefile.

  user@hostname:build_path$make install


  (a) You must have permissions to alter the directory where cgns 
    will be installed.
