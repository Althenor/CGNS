This is a Tcl/Tk graphical interface for displaying
and editing ADF/CGNS files.

Under Unix/Linux, you first need to build
the adfwish executable. To do this, you will need to
edit the Makefile and set up the path to the CGNS
library and ADF directory. You may also need to set
the path for the tk.h include file and the Tcl/Tk
libraries. Once you have built adfwish, you can run
the program as:

    adfwish adfviewer.tcl [ADFfile]

where 'ADFfile' is an optional ADF/CGNS filename.

A shell script, 'adfviewer', is provided to do this also.
You may need to edit adfviewer to set up paths to the
Tcl/Tk scrpits and the libraries (if shared). You may
also need to do a 'chmod +x adfviewer' to make it executable.
Then

    adfviewer [ADFfile]

should start the program.

Under Windows, the normal wish command is used, and the ADF
routines are linked in using a DLL. Edit the Makefile.win32
file to set up the paths to CGNS and Tcl/Tk, then make the
adftcl??.dll. The ?? is replaced with the Tcl/Tk version.
You should then be able to run with

    wish?? adfviewer.tcl [ADFfile]

or edit the 'adfviewer.bat' batch file and run

    adfviewer [ADFfile]

FINAL NOTE: There is a known problem with ADF when trying
to access links from a file opened in OLD or UNKNOWN mode
when then linked-to file is READ_ONLY. I have include an
updated ADF_internals.c file in the adf_patch subdirectory
which fixes this problem.
